### 1.	Description
“Valencia’s Order” is a small clothing shop specializing in ordering, shipping, and supplying clothing items from Guangzhou to Vietnam. They have 2-3 branches in Hanoi city centre and Facebook, Instagram page. The customers that the store targets are young people with personality or bold American style. 
2.	Current IT setup
-	Point of sale (POS) system: This is the system that is used to process sales transactions and manage inventory. A POS system typically includes a cash register, a barcode scanner, and a receipt printer.
-	Inventory management system: This system is used to track and manage the inventory of clothing and other products in the store. It can help ensure that the store always has the right products in stock and can help prevent overstocking or understocking.
-	Customer relationship management (CRM) system: This system is used to manage customer interactions and relationships. It can help the store track customer information, such as contact details and purchase history, and can be used to send personalized marketing messages to customers.
-	Security cameras and alarms: These systems are used to protect the store and its employees from theft and other security threats. Security cameras can help deter potential thieves and can provide evidence in the event of a crime, while security alarms can alert the store and local authorities to potential threats.
-	Network infrastructure: This includes the hardware and software that is used to connect the store's various IT systems and devices, such as computers, servers, and POS terminals. A reliable and secure network infrastructure is essential for the smooth operation of the store's IT systems.
### 3.	Recommendation
The findings of this study concluded that the “Cloud Computing System” is best for “Valencia’s Order”. And we suggest a “Private Clouding System” for “Valencia’s Order” because of following reasons.
1.	In cloud computing system provides the data and services at any time, anywhere in the world and by using any type of devices with the internet connection e.g. smartphone, computer etc. 
2.	The on-demand self-service and no or interference of third party.
3.	It reduces the IT services charges and help in storing and sharing data on large scale.
4.	Scalability (flexibility of choosing data and timing of using the services). 
5.	This system also helps in celebration of data and provide security of data, keep the data safety from the danger of virus or hacker. 
All of these characteristics of “Cloud Computing System” make it more attractive for the users to believe and run this process. While the “Non-cloud Computing System” just provides the facilities of storing and sharing the data at local data and even the customers or the managers will not access the data from all over the world at any time. There are many previous studies, for instance (Ramaiah, 2021; Song et al., 2021; Ahmad et al., 2020 and Chen et al., 2020) also uses the “Cloud Computing system” for sharing, saving and protecting the data of their organization. All these organizations having work related to textile similar to the present study.
